Phase 5: Advanced Security and Monitoring Infrastructure (Week 5)
Implement advanced security controls and develop monitoring capabilities.
Deliverables (Journal and Video):
1. Implement Access Control using SELinux or AppArmor, with documentation showing how to 
track and report on access control settings.
2. Configure automatic security updates with evidence of implementation
3. Configure fail2ban for enhanced intrusion detection
4. Create a security baseline verification script (`security-baseline.sh`) that runs on the server
(executed via SSH) and verifies all security configurations from Phases 4 and 5.
5. Create a remote monitoring script (`monitor-server.sh`) that runs on your workstation, 
connects via SSH, and collects performance metrics from the server.
Note:
All scripts should include line-by-line comments explaining their functionality. All 
implementations must be demonstrated in your video with live command execution and 
explanation.
